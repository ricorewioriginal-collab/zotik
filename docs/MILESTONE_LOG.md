# Phase 1 – Milestone Log

The project owner authorized continuous work through the milestones on 2026-10-02 ("Arbeite fortlaufend …").
Each milestone is a separate commit. Tests are executed with Godot 4.7 headless:
`GODOT=<godot 4.7> tools/run_tests.sh [--json=$PWD/mcp/test_results.json] [filter]`; CI runs the same suite (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).

## M00 Repository Audit – PASSED
See `docs/PHASE_1_AUDIT.md`.

## M01 Boot & Project Core – PASSED
- New Godot 4.7 project `game/zotik/` (C-09). The legacy starter is untouched.
- Autoloads: `EventBus` (gameplay facts), `App` (version, scene switching with missing-scene guard).
- Scenes: `boot` → `title` (Neues Spiel / Beenden) → `game_root` (World + UI layer).
- Input map: legacy actions kept and extended with jump, interact, camera, use_item, menu, inventory, quest_log, puzzle_reset and puzzle_hint (C-07). Attack moved from Space to LMB/J because Space is now jump.
- Headless test runner `tests/run_tests.gd` with `TestCase` base. It exits non-zero on failures, which was checked with a failing sentinel test.
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_m01_boot.gd` (5 tests).
